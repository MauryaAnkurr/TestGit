git log — all — grep=’day of week’

 Branch
List all branches:
   git branch
   
Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch:
   git checkout -b branch_name
   
Create branch from commit:
   git branch branch_name sha1_of_commit
   
Push the branch to remote:
   git push origin branch_name
   
Rename other branch:
   git branch -m old new
   
Rename current branch:
   git branch -m new
   
Rename remote branch:
  git branch -m old new               # Rename branch locally    
  git push origin :old                 # Delete the old branch    
  git push --set-upstream origin new # Push the new branch, set local branch to track the new remote

Delete a branch:
  git branch -D the_local_branch
  git push origin :the_remote_branch

Delete all local branches but master
  git branch | grep -v "master" | xargs git branch -D
