Set Up Git:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"

other commands
git clone (url)
git add (file names)
git commit -m "(committed message)
git push -u origin master
git remote add origin master (url)
git diff


You can show changes that have been staged with the --cached flag:
git diff --cached

In more recent versions of git, you can also use the --staged flag (--staged is a synonym for --cached):
git diff --staged
